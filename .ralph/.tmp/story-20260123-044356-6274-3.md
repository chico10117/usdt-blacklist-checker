### US-003: [P2] Implement schema: user settings + saved reports + watchlist
Status: in_progress
Depends on: US-002

Description:
As an authenticated user, I want my privacy setting and saved artifacts stored server-side so that my choices persist across devices and sessions.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Create tables for `user_settings`, `saved_reports`, and `watchlist_items` per the PRD data model (adapted to the chosen ORM).
- [ ] Include indexes for `userId` and `addressHash` to support listing and per-address queries.
- [ ] Include a keyed-hash strategy for `addressHash` (no plain SHA256 without a secret).
- [ ] Example: Two different users can save the same address without collisions (rows are scoped by userId).
- [ ] Negative case: Attempting to query another user’s data by id/address is blocked at the query layer (always filter by authenticated userId).
