### US-008: [P3] Add authenticated dashboard layout with sidebar navigation
Status: in_progress
Depends on: US-007

Description:
As an authenticated user, I want a dashboard layout with dedicated pages so that navigation and data management are clear and scalable.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Add a post-login dashboard layout with vertical left sidebar (Overview, History, Watchlist, Settings) and active-route styling.
- [ ] Ensure unauthenticated access to dashboard routes is blocked/redirected using Clerk patterns consistent with the repo.
- [ ] Keep the existing home page behavior for unauthenticated users (free checks and CTA).
- [ ] Example: Signed-in user can navigate between pages without full reload (App Router navigation).
- [ ] Negative case: Visiting `/overview` while signed out redirects to sign-in (or shows 401) and does not render dashboard content.
