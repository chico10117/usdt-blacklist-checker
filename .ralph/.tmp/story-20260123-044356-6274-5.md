### US-005: [P2] Add Settings screen with privacy toggle and copy
Status: in_progress
Depends on: US-004

Description:
As an authenticated user, I want a Settings screen that explains and controls saving so that I can make an informed privacy choice.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Add `/settings` route (dashboard context) with a clear toggle for `Save screening history` (loggingEnabled) defaulting to off.
- [ ] Include concise explanatory copy describing what gets stored when enabled and what does not when disabled.
- [ ] UI shows loading, success, and error states when reading/updating the setting.
- [ ] Example: User enables saving, sees confirmation, and the UI reflects enabled state after reload.
- [ ] Negative case: If settings API fails, UI shows an error state and does not silently flip the toggle.
