### US-007: [P2] Add History list + report detail + deletion (single + all)
Status: in_progress
Depends on: US-006

Description:
As an authenticated user, I want to view and manage my saved reports so that I can track screening outcomes over time while retaining control.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Add `/history` route showing a paginated (or bounded) list of saved reports for the current user (newest first).
- [ ] Provide per-report delete and delete-all actions with confirmation UI.
- [ ] Add a report detail view (route or modal) that renders the saved reportJson with evidence links.
- [ ] Example: User deletes one report and it disappears immediately and stays deleted after refresh.
- [ ] Negative case: User cannot fetch or delete another user’s report id; API returns 404/403 without leaking existence.
