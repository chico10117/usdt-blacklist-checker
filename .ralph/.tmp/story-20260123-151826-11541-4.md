### US-013: [P4] Define credits model and usage accounting (documentation-first)
Status: in_progress
Depends on: US-001

Description:
As the product owner, I want a defined credits model so that future billing and feature gating can be implemented without ambiguity.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Add a short spec doc defining credit units (e.g., per analysis, per deep trace, per saved report) and what is free vs gated.
- [ ] Define usage accounting rules (when a credit is consumed, idempotency, retries, refunds) and abuse prevention considerations.
- [ ] Define entitlement checks at a high level (where in API routes enforcement will occur) without implementing billing yet.
- [ ] Example: Spec includes a worked example of a user running analyses until credits reach zero and what UI messaging appears.
- [ ] Negative case: Spec explicitly covers how to prevent accidental double-charging on retries/timeouts.
