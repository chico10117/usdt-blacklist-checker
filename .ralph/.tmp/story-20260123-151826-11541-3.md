### US-009: [P3] Add Watchlist CRUD (UI + API) for tracked addresses
Status: in_progress
Depends on: US-008

Description:
As an authenticated user, I want to maintain a watchlist so that I can quickly re-screen frequently used counterparties.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Add API routes to list/add/remove watchlist items for the current user.
- [ ] Validate TRON address format on add; store addressHash for indexing and apply the defined storage policy for raw address fields.
- [ ] Add `/watchlist` UI with add form, list rows (address + optional label), and remove action.
- [ ] Example: User adds an address with label 'Merchant A' and it appears in the list and persists after refresh.
- [ ] Negative case: Adding an invalid address fails with a validation message and no DB write occurs.
