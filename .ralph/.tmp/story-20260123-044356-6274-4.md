### US-004: [P2] Add API: user settings (loggingEnabled) with safe defaults
Status: in_progress
Depends on: US-003

Description:
As an authenticated user, I want to enable/disable report saving via Settings so that I can control whether my screening history is persisted.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Add API route(s) to read and update `loggingEnabled` for the current Clerk user (default false if no row exists).
- [ ] Ensure unauthenticated requests are rejected (401/redirect per existing patterns).
- [ ] Ensure API logs do not include raw addresses and avoid logging full request bodies.
- [ ] Example: Toggling `loggingEnabled` from false to true persists and is reflected on refresh.
- [ ] Negative case: Unauthenticated request to update settings returns 401 and does not create DB rows.
