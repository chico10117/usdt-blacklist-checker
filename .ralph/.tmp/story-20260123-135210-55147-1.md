### US-006: [P2] Add Save Report flow (UI + API) gated by loggingEnabled
Status: in_progress
Depends on: US-005

Description:
As an authenticated user who enabled saving, I want to save a specific analysis result so that I can refer to it later.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Add a server API route to create a SavedReport for the current user from a validated payload (address + report data).
- [ ] Enforce: saving is allowed only when authenticated AND loggingEnabled is true.
- [ ] Store `reportJson` plus summary fields (riskScore/riskTier/confidence/window) for fast listing and timeline views.
- [ ] Update the main analysis UI to show a `Save this report` control only when authenticated and loggingEnabled is enabled.
- [ ] Example: After running analysis, clicking Save creates a History entry and shows a success toast/state.
- [ ] Negative case: If loggingEnabled is false, Save is hidden/disabled and the API returns a clear error if called directly.
