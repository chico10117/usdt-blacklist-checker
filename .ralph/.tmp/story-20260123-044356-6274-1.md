### US-001: [P2] Decide DB + ORM and document data retention policy
Status: in_progress
Depends on: None

Description:
As the maintainer, I want a documented decision for database provider and ORM (plus retention/privacy policy) so that report saving can be implemented consistently and safely.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Add an ADR-style doc that selects: Postgres provider approach (e.g., Neon/Vercel Postgres) and ORM choice (Drizzle or Prisma) with rationale and tradeoffs.
- [ ] Define a retention policy (e.g., unlimited by default with optional caps) and explicitly state what is stored when loggingEnabled is true vs false.
- [ ] Update `.env.example` with any required env vars for the chosen approach (e.g., `DATABASE_URL`, `ADDRESS_HASH_KEY` or equivalent).
- [ ] Example: Doc includes a worked example of saving a report and what fields are persisted.
- [ ] Negative case: Doc explicitly covers what happens when `DATABASE_URL` is missing (features disabled gracefully; app still builds).
