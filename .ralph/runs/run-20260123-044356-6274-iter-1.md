Story: US-001 — Decide DB + ORM and document data retention policy

## Outcome

- Added ADR documenting Postgres provider approach and ORM decision (Drizzle), including tradeoffs.
- Defined privacy/retention rules for opt-in report saving and explicit behavior when `DATABASE_URL` is missing.
- Updated `.env.example` with required/optional env vars for future persistence.

## Verification

- `pnpm lint` — PASS
- `pnpm test` — PASS
- `pnpm build` — PASS

## Notes

- Current `loggingEnabled` is a client-side localStorage preference; persistence is not implemented yet.
